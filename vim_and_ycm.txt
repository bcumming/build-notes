===================
make and install vim just python and install in apps
===================

this is the default, with python 2 enabled (turned off by default)

./configure --enable-pythoninterp=yes --prefix=/apps/santis/vim/7.4


=======================
THEN MAKE YouCompleteME
=======================

the PATH_TO_LLVM_ROOT is the path where libclang.so can be found. I used a version that
I compiled myself, though this isn't recommended.

I had to export CC and CXX, because the Cray compiler wrappers for gcc caused an odd
linking error.

cd ${path_to_vim_config}/bundle/YouCompleteMe
mkdir build
cd build
export CC=`which gcc`
export CXX=`which g++`
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DPATH_TO_LLVM_ROOT=/apps/daint/clang/3.4/ . ../third_party/ycmd/cpp
ccmake .
.... and turn on support for Clang code completion for C-family
